Throughout the course we will have some special guest speakers join us virtually to give you their expertise on a variety of subjects. 

We've asked the speakers to present a bit on their background and what they do but also to talk specifically about topics pertainng the the course curriculum. 

Each speacker has also been asked to impart two *vital* pieces of information to you on how to be a successful ecologist. We are leaving this totally up to them to decide what they think you should know!

### Key information to be gathered from the presentation:

1. Name of Speaker
2. Job/ position/ location
3. Breif summary of what they do in their job/position/rsearch. This piece is for your own records. Be detailed if their career choice or lecture topic is of particular interest to you. 
4. **What are the two vital pieces of information they presented?**
5. **How can you use the information they presented during this course?**
6. **How can you use the information presented outside of this corse?**

### At the end of the term you will write a reflection on (15 points):
- What you learned from the entire speaker series (5 points)
- Three vital pieces of information were given to you to suceed as ecologists (6 points)
- How some (if any) information from the lectures you were able to use during the course (4 points)
