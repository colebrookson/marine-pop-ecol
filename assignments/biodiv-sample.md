So far, we have primarily focused on experiments that exclude or transplant organisms to test hypotheses about the influence of abiotic factors (e.g. environmental temperature and submergence time) and biotic interactions (e.g. predation, competition, facilitation) on biodiversity patterns within intertidal sites. Now we will consider how comparative studies (i.e. observations across multiple locations) can help us to evaluate hypotheses about community structure varies between intertidal sites with different properties. 

**How do habitat factors like wave exposure and substrate type influence intertidal species diversity and abundance?**

We are going to address this question by sampling and comparing intertidal invertebrate communities at sites that differ in habitat structure near to BMSC. Specifically, we will focus on Scott’s Bay, which is home to abundant intertidal life occupying high wave exposure habitats (outside of the bay) and low wave exposure habitats (inside the bay). Intertidal species vary greatly in abundance, body sizes, appearance (e.g. cryptic colorations), and mobility. As a result, one sampling method is unlikely to accurately capture the distribution and abundance of all the community members within the intertidal zone. 

## Assignment Goal

In class, you will generate hypotheses about various aspects of habitat structure (e.g. wave exposure and substrate type) that influences species diversity in the intertidal zone. We’ll then discuss the utility of a range of approaches used by intertidal ecologists to sample species with different characteristics. We will then work together to develop a sampling scheme to assess the diversity and abundance of the species you learned to ID in Assignment #1. Then, on Thursday afternoon we will head into the field and put the sampling plan in to action. 

This project involves group work (~4 students per group) in the field and to write up the project. Field data collected by each group will be pooled to produce a class-wide data set for the analysis. Overarching project tasks include:  

1. Field data collection (on Oct 25th) 
2. Data management (entry, quality assurance, and meta-data creation; by Oct 26th)
3. Data analysis & graphing
4. Elevator pitch presentations (Nov 1st)

Each phase is described in more detail below. 

## 1. Field Data Collection

We will carry out biodiversity sampling at Scott's Bay on the morning low tide (1.8m @ 0920) on Monday, Oct 25th. We will work together in class on Thursday morning to develop the spatial sampling plan, create data sheets for recording information generated by each sampling method, and conduct a dry run of the plan. Sampling equipment includes transect tapes, quadrats, clipboard, data sheets, and pencil. 

## 2. Data Entry and Sharing
