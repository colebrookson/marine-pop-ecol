### After slides on exp. growth eq

We are actually just saying this: 

$$N_{t+1} = 2N_t$$

which is essentially just saying that the number of lily pads next week will be twice the number this week. 

More generally, we can state this as:

$$N_{t+1} = \lambda N_t$$ where lambda is the *population growth rate*. 

Recall in our example of $\lambda = 2$ that the number of indvidiauls if we think about consecutive weeks is actually 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 or $2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5$. 

So we can rewrite the equation as $$ N_t = \lambda^t$$
