# Population Modeling Assignment Overview

Population models can take many forms, but with populations we classify as age/stage-structured, building models to explicitly account for those stages is helpful. The purpose of this assignment is to introduce you to modeling stage-structured populations in the form of matrix models. This assignment has two parts. Part 1 is a brief p proposal of research so that we can make sure you are on the right track. Part 2 requires you to do research on your own and build a matrix model with accompanying write up. You will: 

1. Select a species to analyse their population growth
2. Report the life history of the species including stage structure 
3. Draw a life-cycle graph of species demography
4. Write a set of equations for population growth of the species
5. Using the published literature, parameterize your model
6. Assess the population growth rate for your species
7. Perform an elasticity analysis of the growth rate
8. Contextualize your results in the relevant literature

This project will be done in **groups of two students.** You are both expected to contribute equally to the project. You will both be required to turn in *identical* reports. 

# Submitted Content

## Proposal
For this project, each group must submit a brief, 500 word proposal covering points 1-5 above. The purpose of this proposal is for the instructors to ensure you are on the right path, and to give you feedback on the model before you analyse it. The proposal should have:

1. A brief paragraph on the species you selected, and it's life history. In this section, explicitly discuss the foundational papers on the species that you are using to describe the population and stage structure. 
2. The life cycle-graph denoting all relevant parameters symbolically 
3. All equations for your model, and a corresponding table with parameter values and citations of where they are coming from. In cases where numerical values for parameters cannot be found, values can be chosen from closely related species or a rationale could be provided for the range of values that will be considered in your analysis.

See the grading rubric regarding how the proposal will be graded. 

## Final Report

The final report will cover all the objectives listed above. It will be a maximum of
