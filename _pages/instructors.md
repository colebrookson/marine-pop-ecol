Alex is a Black woman, a marine ecologist, and a conservation scientist. She originally got her BA in English Literature before realizing she wanted to study the ocean. She did her undergraduate degree in Marine Science at Cal State Monterey Bay (CSUMB), and went on to get her PhD at the University of Oregon working on invasive lionfish. She is currently a Liber Ero Fellow working with Dr. Stephanie Green (University of Alberta), and Dr. Thomas Therriault (Fisheries and Oceans Canada) on invasive European green crab removal on the west coast of Canada and the Salish Sea. ​When she is not sciencing she spends time at home with her cats, crocheting, reading, watching sci-fi movies and TV, and eating tacos and popcorn.
