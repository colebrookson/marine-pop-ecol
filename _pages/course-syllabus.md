## Course Description 

This course explores fundamental theories in marine ecology at population, community, and ecosystem levels of biological organization. Our discussions and activities will draw on primary research literature, with an emphasis on case studies from temperate Pacific nearshore marine ecosystems. We will explore topics including population dynamics and regulation, life history patterns, ecological subsidies, food webs, indirect effects, introduced species, fisheries, and at-risk species using field, laboratory, and quantitative modeling approaches. We will explore these concepts through the lens of conserving and managing wild populations.

### Research skills 

During field trips and in the lab, you will learn many of the practical tools
marine ecologists use to evaluate the status of populations and communities (e.g. species identification, natural history observation, intertidal sampling, and historical ecology techniques). Regular paper discussions will develop and reinforce your ability to efficiently digest and critically evaluate peer-reviewed scientific literature. You will also learn essential quantitative modeling skills through the construction and assesment of a stage-based population model. Throughout the course you will gain hands-on training in computational analysis, programming, and version control. For this course we will be using R/RStudio (an open source statistical programming language and IDE (Integrated Development Environment)), and Git/GitHub, the industry standard version control software. Throughout these activities you will hone your skills in critical thinking, creative problem solving, logical reasoning, effective collaboration, and clear visual and verbal communication.

### Physical requirements

Although this course does not include any physical exertion or
challenge beyond that expected in any of BMSC’s field courses. However, activities including many trips to intertidal field sites involve getting on and off boats onto slippery rocks in sometimes wavy conditions.

### Academic integrity:

Academic integrity requires commitment to the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. It is expected that students, faculty members and staff at BMSC, as members of an intellectual community, will adhere to these ethical values in all activities related to learning, teaching, research and service. Any action that contravenes this standard, including misrepresentation, falsification or deception, undermines the intention and worth of scholarly work and violates the fundamental academic rights of members of our community. This policy is designed to ensure that the university’s standards are upheld in a fair and transparent fashion. Students are responsible for the entire content and form of their work. Nothing in this policy is
intended to prohibit students from developing their academic skills through the exchange of ideas and the utilization of resources available to support learning. Students who are in doubt as to what constitutes a violation of academic integrity in a particular instance should consult their course instructor or refer to individual school policies for more details.
