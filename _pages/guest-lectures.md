During the course we have some excellent guest speakers lined up to discuss a variety of topics with us, including their research, how they got their jobs and what is it they actually "do", and their philosophies of science. 

Along with the associated [assignment](/assignments/guest-speakers.md), please come prepared ready to ask questions of the speaker - they are here for you to learn from!

## Confirmed Speakers:

### Dr. Shannon M. Hennessey <img align="left" src="/assets/images/shannon-m-h.jpg" style="padding: 15px" alt="drawing" width="300"/>

Dr. Hennessey completed her PhD at Oregon State University with Dr. Mark Novak. She is a scientific illustrator, a researcher, and a conservation practioner. 

She is an empirical and quantitatively-trained marine ecologist, broadly interested in the impacts of humans and environmental stressors on fish and invertebrate populations, species interactions, and community structure. website: [https://shannonmhennessey.weebly.com/](https://shannonmhennessey.weebly.com/)

### Emma M. Atkinson <img align="left" src="/assets/images/emma-m-a.jpg" style="padding: 15px" alt="drawing" width="300"/>

Emma is a PhD student at the University of Alberta with Dr. Mark Lewis. Previously, in her undergraduate thesis work at Simon Fraser University and following work with the Pacific Salmon Foundation focused on assessing the population health of Pacific salmon on the British Columbian coast. Emma is a hybrid between a "boots wet" ecologist and an applied mathematician, and enjoys asking and answering questions by confronting her models with data. 

Her current research questions focuses on the population dynamics and fisheries management of marine invertebrates, specifically the British Columbian spot prawn fishery. When she's not coding in R, she likes to cycle, run, and spend time on the water.


### Dr. Karlisa Calwood <img align="left" src="/assets/images/karlissa.jpeg" style="padding: 15px" alt="drawing" width="300"/>

Dr. Calwood is a fisheries ecologist who received her PhD from University of Miami in 2016. Her disertation project coupled biophysical modeling, marine ecology, socio-economics, and anthropology to assess the state of the Bahamian Spiny Lobster fishery. She previously completed her MSc thesis, focused on larval connectivity of the Caribbean spiny lobster's habitat. Trained as an ecologist, she uses an interdisciplinary approach to understand what's happening at fisheries from a social side. Much of her work invovles having conversations with different folks involved in fisheries -- fishers, consumers, policy makers -- and gathering a holistic understanding of systems, as opposed to just biological and ecological understandings. 

In addition to fisheries research, Karlisa has over a decade of experience developing and managing science education programming. She has created and overseen the implementation of a variety of science programs (including camps, outreach activities, field trips, college-bound training, field studies, science demos and theater, homeschool, citizen science research projects, curriculum development, and professional development) at organizations like the Miami Science Museum, the Deering Estate at Cutler, Breakthrough Miami, the Miami Science Barge, and the Port Townsend Marine Science Center.  Her experience includes the management of several programs focused specifically on engaging students from underrepresented and underserved communities in Miami. She has also worked as part of the team responsible for the planning and development of exhibits and related programs for the Living Core aquarium within the newly constructed Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science, with a focus on creating engaging experiences for visitors of all ages.  She currently serves as the Director of the Community Conservation Action Program at the Perry Institute for Marine Science.
