During the course we have some excellent guest speakers lined up to discuss a variety of topics with us, including their research, how they got their jobs and what is it they actually "do", and their philosophies of science. 

Along with the associated [assignment](/assignments/guest-speakers.md), please come prepared ready to ask questions of the speaker - they are here for you to learn from!
